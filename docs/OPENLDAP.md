## Overview
The LDAP database is an essential part of this project.
It is responsible for storing the teachers, students, classes and which teachers have administrator privileges.

The API handles these split into three groups:
- [entities](#entities)
- [groups](#groups)
- [key-value pairs](#key-value-pairs)

The teachers and students are entities.\
If a teacher or student is no longer needed they can be put into the `inactive` group which prevents teachers if they are admins from logging in.\
A teacher is an admin if they are part of the `admin` group.
The classes that the students can be a part of or the teachers can be in charge of are stores as a key-value pair under the name `classes`. 
The password of the [default admin](#default-admin) and wether or not it is enabled is also stored as two key value pairs.


## Default Admin
The default admin acts as an admin teacher, but does not actually exist as an entity.\
It instead is defined by two [environment variables](../README.md#environment-variables).

The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` env specifies the username the default admin should use to authenticate itself and is not stored within the database and is read each time the API starts.

The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env on the other hand is hashed using bcrypt and put into the database's `default-admin-password` key-value pair when the default admin is created by the API.

The other key-value pair of the default admin is the `default-admin-enabled` which is set to `true` by default. It specifies wether the default admin is enabled, meaning it is able to login or not.

> If the default admin's key-value pairs are deleted they are automatically recreated by the API.


## Entities
The entities always have an associated [model](../NeuLdapMgnt/Models/) which defines how it should be handled by the API.

The class of the models can use the [LdapObjectClasses](../NeuLdapMgnt/Models/LdapAttributes.cs) attribute to specify the object classes they should have within the LDAP database.

The properties of these classes can use the [LdapAttribute](../NeuLdapMgnt/Models/LdapAttributes.cs) attribute to specify which LDAP attribute they should bind to and if they count as hidden or not.\
If an attribute is marked as hidden, then it is not set or returned from the database by default. An example for this is the `userPassword` which does not need to be updated or returned in most cases.


## Groups
Groups store the `uid`s of the entities that belong in the group.
> If an entity is deleted and they belong in a group, their uid is not removed from the group.


## Key-value pairs
Key-value pairs are meant to store data that does not have a complex type like an entity. They are identified by a string key and can store a string value.\
For example, the `default-admin-enabled` key can store a boolean in string from.
